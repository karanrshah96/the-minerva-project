# Greedy Algorithms

## Overview
While solving a multifaceted and complex problem, it is difficult to create a blueprint that can solve it most efficiently. This is where greedy algorithms come into play. It is important to identify such problems that may not have an optimal solution and implement it using a greedy approach

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand what the Greedy Approach is
- Be able to identify problems that lie in this domain
- Tackle these problems with ease and implement solutions

## Introduction

Imagine an Amazon employee that needs to make say ten deliveries across the city. He has a map with all the delivery points and is starting from the head office. It can be difficult to calculate the most optimal route that can take him to all the delivery points and back to the office. So he decides to go to the closest one first and keep doing that till he makes his last delivery. This strategy is called as the <b> Greedy Approach </b>. In fact this is a very famous problem in computer science and is called as the "Travelling Salesman Problem".<br>

Greedy algorithms work in stages. In each stage, a decision is made that is good at that point,
without bothering about the future. This means that some local best is chosen. It assumes that a
local good selection makes for a global optimal solution. However, making locally optimal choices does not always work. Hence, Greedy algorithms will not always
give the best solutions.
